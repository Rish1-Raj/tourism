        <p>Location: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/HaUMk4kSBPHS7r43A" target="_blank">Nalanda District, Bihar</a></p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Nalanda is a historic town in Bihar, India, famous for its ancient university, Nalanda University. This university was one of the world’s first and most important learning centers, built over 1,500 years ago during the Gupta Empire. It attracted students and teachers from many countries like China, Korea, and Persia, who came to study subjects like Buddhism, medicine, astronomy, and mathematics.  

            For hundreds of years, Nalanda was a place of great knowledge and learning. However, in the 12th century, it was attacked and destroyed by an invader named Bakhtiyar Khilji. Today, the ruins of the university are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and visitors can see the remains of old classrooms, temples, and a huge library. In 2010, a new Nalanda University was built nearby to continue its legacy as a place of knowledge and learning for students from around the world.</p>
